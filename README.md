## Background

Javascript is missing some common data structures (like Heaps and Tries) that are available in other natively in other languages. These data structures can be helpful when solving algorithm challenges.

Additionally, Javascript engines non-configurable decisions about which algorithms to use for e.g. [sorting](https://v8.dev/blog/array-sort).


This repo is serves a dual purpose: give me a chance to practice implementing common data structures and algorithms not built into JS, and also place to quickly copy and paste them from.
